  "description": "More than a company, Koach is a group of passionate individuals who want to create a large impact on society. This belief drives us to make employability & life skills learning accessible to all, especially in the service sector. This sector is home to one of the largest workforces in India & their distinct lack of learning opportunities leads to a huge skill gap & aspiration to ability mismatch. The Koach.AI platform enables youth to gain critical skills to GET their first job, KEEP their jobs, and GROW their careers meaningfully. Our foundation is the Science of Coaching, which applies to all endeavors of performance & helps individuals internalize what they need to focus on. By combining the KoachUp platform with a unique classroom pedagogy and 1:1 mentor support, Koach takes learning from a linear to a blended pedagogy to help individuals assimilate & apply skills practically. Having tested our approach across youth in different cities, Koach is proud to have brought out a significant improvement in their life skills (verified by 3rd-party Assessment), placing them in their first jobs.",
