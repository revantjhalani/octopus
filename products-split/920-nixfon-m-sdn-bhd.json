  "description": "In August 2003, two guys, one left penniless after a failed business venture and the other, feeling frustrated working for unappreciative bosses got together to form a new tech start-up. We registered Nixfon (M) Sdn Bhd as business in November 2003 and started to hit the ground running. We formed Nixfon because we found very few technology companies really understood HR\u2019s needs, pains and processes. We were a bunch of HR and Learning guys who got intrigued by technology. We knew moving forward technology would change the whole HR and Learning & Development (L&D) landscape. We want to be the trusted advisors that HR, L&D managers and organizations can depend on when they are sourcing for systems and solutions for their Digital Transformation. Our continued focus in HR and Learning Technology gave us the opportunity to partner with some of the best Learning Technology and Learning content vendors in the world. With a wide range of complimenting products and services, we can safely say we are one of the leading regional firms in Learning technology space.",
