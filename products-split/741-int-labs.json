We also strongly believe that the majority of world changing innovations actually happen at corporations, rather than startups. We are passionate about unlocking the innovative potential of those who are crazy enough to try. We are a boutique innovation agency founded by active entrepreneurs and startup founders. Our vision at Int Labs is to empower people to imagine, and build innovative solutions for the world. We understand innovation.",
