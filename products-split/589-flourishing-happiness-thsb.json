  "description": "Flourishing Happiness (FH) envisioned a perpetual ripple effect through propagation and advocacy; we are a vehicle to a ride and a support platform for your aspirations. In particular, for people with mental health conditions and substance dependency issues. We design a specially curated, safe platform for the individual with telltale stories. A story that is so profound that it became an enabler that empowers and inspires you to tell your story to move the world. In the process, it assists others in getting out of their shells and creating a flourishing wheel. The one question we need to ask is, how can I destigmatise it all; it hurts as it affects my social life. Hence, the birth of THSB propagates the innate desire to be free and to stand up with dignity.",
