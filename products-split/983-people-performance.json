  "description": "People Performance International was born with the spirit of helping people to get to know themselves better through assessments that promote personal and professional development as well as the alignment of the person with the job position most appropriate to their personality style. However, the foundations behind the project began to be forged many years earlier through the experience and development of its founders. In 2012 we developed a global vision and strategy, expanding especially to the South American and European markets and later also entering the African continent. Nowadays we are a company in constant growth with the firm conviction that we can have a global scope as well as a local presence, and for this we have developed a strong international structure of Agents and Distributors that ensure our proximity to the end customer from the power of a global company.",
