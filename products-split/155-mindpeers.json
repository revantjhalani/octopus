  "description": "Mindpeers believe we\u2019re crazy enough to change the world. Mental health was a stigma because we have never understood its science. Psychology, neuroscience, behavioral science - they tell you that all emotions are important, they reveal why we behave the we do. We\u2019re not going to stop until every individual gives their mind the love and care it deserves, for being proud of taking care of their mental health. And if in this process, someone calls you crazy, we say be crazy because the crazy ones change the world",
