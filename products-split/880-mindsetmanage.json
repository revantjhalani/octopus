  "description": "Mindset was born out of frustration with the inability of existing employee engagement solutions to deliver anything more than top-level feedback to executives, and with the frequent failed initiatives intended to change leadership behavior that instead collected dust on a shelf. This frustration lead to Johan Poolman teaming up with Dr Dieter Veldsman to develop the Flow@Work employee engagement model, which ultimately morphed into a team of HR tech and startup veterans, industrial psychologists, software engineers, and data scientists who share the common belief that organizations can truly drive sustainable employee engagement - provided they are given the right data, tools, and know-how. With this as our focus, Mindset is now an international team with big plans, and our vision has not changed: we still believe that driving sustainable engagement requires the right information, in the right hands, at the right time. Follow our story as we continue to grow, driving innovation and helping to build workplaces that we as employees - and as people - would be proud to be a part of.",
