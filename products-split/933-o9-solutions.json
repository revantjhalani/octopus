  "description": "Better, faster planning and decision-making translates directly to better financial results for companies. But it means much more. Global supply chains are the largest consumers of the Earth\u2019s resources. Better, faster planning and decision-making means enterprises are able to achieve their financial goals while using less of the Earth\u2019s precious resources. Better, faster planning and decision-making also drives more transparency. It reduces organizational silos, empowers people, and increases productivity. This translates further into inspired employees who can better contribute to society. Our mission is to provide global companies with a game-changing planning platform to transform their supply chain, commercial, finance, and sustainability decision-making.",
