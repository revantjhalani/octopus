  "description": "Caregiver Saathi serves as the dedicated companion for caregivers. We are committed to recognising and supporting caregivers by providing comprehensive, end-to-end services for caregivers and their loved ones in need of care, offering a wide array of resources, programs, support groups and an intuitive app to help manage care effectively. Being a caregiver to a loved one facing a terminal illness or chronic condition is an incredibly challenging journey. There are everyday challenges of a whole new life -with visits to the doctor, the struggles of discovering that your loved one is ill and the challenges of keeping the spirits up for the loved one and even, for the rest of the family. Often, the new situation is so overwhelming and consuming that the caregiver simply goes about doing their best without really paying attention to themselves. Emotions like anger and pain at the situation, sometimes guilt of not looking after the patient as well as they wished to, guilt of thinking about themselves and the loss of one\u2019s life as one had hoped it to be. Given the social context in India, most caregivers feel such emotions have no place.",
