Prior to starting Keka, our core teams was a 100 person business that needed an easy to use software for managing employees. We looked everywhere and all we found were software that was lousy and hard to use. We felt SME businesses in India deserved something better. Something awesome actually! \r\nThe goal was simple. Automate and simplify people processes so you can focus on your core asset - the employees. They, in turn, will transform you from a good to a great organization!",
