  "description": "At Asia Market Entry, we recognise that international software companies are often unable to relocate their own staff to the Asia region, do not want to setup a local office, or are simply not ready to fully commit to the region yet. We bridge that gap for our customers by helping prove the Asia market before they make a whole-scale investment in the region. We commit to providing our customers with the platform on which they can make the correct long-term decision about their Asia strategy.\n",
