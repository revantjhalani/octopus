  "description": "Companies worldwide are adapting their workspaces to evolving hybrid working patterns while keeping employee preferences at the forefront. They often end up trying to build on technology from a pre-pandemic world or through painful incremental integrations on archaic platforms to respond to the shifting requirements of the changing work environment. Freespace was founded in 2015 to support flexible working for companies intending to go free-address and evolved into a suite of fully integrated solutions supporting the transition to hybrid over the pandemic. We understand the nuanced balance between business objectives and people-driven goals, and we are uniquely positioned to simplify workspace management, planning, and utilization into a single comprehensive ecosystem. For over seven years, Freespace has provided \"live\" data and actionable insights to globally recognized brands, with over 150,000 app users and 140,000 sensors in 150 cities across the globe.",
