  "description": "First and foremost, if you're trying to get better at technical interviews, the best way to do that is to actually do it. Here, you can get a lens into the kinds of questions you'd encounter at top companies and get comfortable with answering them in a low-pressure, anonymous setting. Beyond that, interviewing here can be a great way to get your foot in the door at top companies. When you do well in practice, you\u2019ll start getting invitations to interview anonymously with great companies right on our platform. If you do well in those interviews, you can unmask, and they count as your technical phone screen. The next step is almost always an onsite. In other words, you can get interviews at top companies without ever touching your resume, applying, haranguing your friends for referrals, or talking to recruiters.",

    "We choose candidates based on past performance in rigorous, live technical interviews. It's a much better predictor of ability than a resume.",
    "Do whatever you'd normally do in your technical phone screen, except do it anonymously to avoid bias.",
    "Our candidates convert 3X better than other channels, and we save our customers 220 hours per hire. With us, you can go from first conversation to offer in less than a week."
