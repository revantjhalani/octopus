  "description": "At Sage, we transform the way people think, work, and leverage AI and machine learning, enabling their organizations to thrive. In 1981, our founder David Goldman wanted to create quotes quickly for his print business and keep track of his accounts. David worked with a team from Newcastle University, including Dr. Paul Muller, a computer expert who worked with NASA, and Graham Wylie, a student. Our founders realized that other businesses could benefit from this too. Some eight years later, Sage was listed on the London Stock Exchange with a \u00a320m (USD 24.5m) valuation.",
