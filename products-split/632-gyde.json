  "description": "Gyde was born out of hours and months of ideation by founders - Prasanna Vaidya & Shubham Deshmukh, their mentors, advisors and early adopters. We were all overwhelmed by the sheer number of applications being launched & purchased and the struggle it was causing for the users to learn & use these myriad applications. We had a common conviction that there had to be a simple yet powerful way to help the software application users to figure out how the application works and how to become good at using it. At the same time, existing solutions were too rigid and lacked intelligence. Gyde was conceptualized as a faster, simpler, and intelligent way to solve this problem at scale.",
