  "description": "keySkillset is a New-York based company operating since 2017 and is a patent pending platform under US law, which has developed a simulation based Learning Management System which helps facilitate practice as you learn.Our story began when Tatiana, our founder and a corporate trainer, started to notice a pattern in the questions asked by her trainees. Most of them were able to understand the concepts, but they faced the challenge of how to practice, how to retain the knowledge they had just acquired. At keySkillset, we strive to help our clients optimize the 40 hours of work per week by doing more in the same number of hours. We help every learner put themselves in an automatic mode to perform basic daily productivity functions 10x to 20x faster.",
