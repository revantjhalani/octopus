  "description": "CHANGE, Inc. Community Action Agency was formed in 1983 by a handful of clergy members who wished to aid families affected by layoffs from Weirton Steel find new employment. Since that time, we have grown into a full-circle agency, addressing many of the needs of the economically disadvantaged. In its 29th year of operation, the belief of empowering families is still strong within the agency. The concept of \u201ccommunity action\u201d was originally conceived as part of the War on Poverty Program launched by the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964. Community Action objectives focused on enabling people to achieve self-sufficiency and providing them with the resources to achieve that goal. The concept of community action, people working together to help people, became widely known throughout the Northern Panhandle. As the concept grew, additional services were developed and interest continued to grow in the community.",
