  "description": "ParentCircle empowers parents to raise successful children through holistic parenting. \u2018Success\u2019 can mean different things to different parents and different children. It may be about the successes in everyday life, or success in sports, academics or any other endeavor, or success in a career, or success in life. At ParentCircle our goal is to support parents as they strive to set up their children for success and ensuing happiness. As they say it takes a village to raise a child. Our mission is to bring together parents, educators, health specialists, child experts and professionals to share their knowledge and experiences to support the physical, emotional, social and intellectual development of children to ensure their success across all fields of endeavour. In India, we are pioneers in providing holistic parenting content in English and in a regional language, Tamil. We reach out to all segments of parents - from parents of infants to parents of teens through our magazines, online portal and apps.",
