  "description": "10 years ago horses brought us together from different parts of the world - Isabelle from Austria and Dhruv who was living in the USA at that time. We see the joy horses bring on people's faces every day, should it be a 3 year old girl or a 65 year old business man. We believe that horses teach us a lot about ourselves and they make us confident and great leaders in business as well as private life. Since 2007, Isabelle has been working in various cities in India. In the past few years Isabelle was engaged in senior management positions for BMW and Liebherr. After managing a team of 100+ people it became evident that the most important ingredient for success is an effective leadership style. Isabelle implemented learning's from the work with her horses to the business environment.",
