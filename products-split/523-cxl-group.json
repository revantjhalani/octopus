  "description": "CareerXcell, founded in 2008, initially focused on training and placing unemployed graduates to combat high unemployment rates and equip them for the job market. As the company grew, a contingent workforce division was established in 2010 to meet the increasing demands of Malaysia\u2019s gig economy. Leveraging extensive experience in the HR industry and expertise in statutory compliance, the payroll and HR outsourcing division was created in 2012, offering reliable and cost-effective solutions to Malaysian businesses. In 2020, CareerXcell embarked on a new venture with The Ability Center, Japan, marking the beginning of a new era as CXL. Expansion plans were set in motion, leading to the establishment of the Executive Search division, which employs a unique recruitment methodology tailored to today\u2019s business landscape. In 2023 CXL merged with Whyze Solutions, a Singapore based HR & Payroll platform provider. This was an opportunity to create competitive advantage and value, while ensuring sustainability, through digital transformation is more compelling than ever. Backed by over 30 years of combined experience in Malaysia and equipped with shared resources, our team continuously strives to set the benchmark by delivering innovative solutions that truly matter to businesses.",
