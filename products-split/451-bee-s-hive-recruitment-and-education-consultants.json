  "description": "Bee\u2019s Hive Talent is a boutique consultancy that specialises in the area of recruitment for mid-sized and small enterprises. We have customised the recruitment process to cater to organisations which have small HR Departments or none at all. We are different from other recruitment agencies because we very carefully screen CVs, and meet candidates in person, just like an in-house HR department would do, and present few CVs of screened candidates who largely fit into the required roles. We save you, or your HR officer, the time and energy by being selective on your behalf. Also, with our very competitive recruitment fee, we save you money. Our response to a client\u2019s mandate is quick, and the big advantage of working with us is that we will continuously communicate and work with you to find you the best candidates within your specified salary range.",

    "With the popularity of quick online \u2018recruiting",
    "the valuable art of screening candidates, actually talking to them and meeting them, has been lost",
    "meet only the candidates with real potential to fit your vacancy."
