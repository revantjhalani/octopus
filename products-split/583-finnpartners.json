  "description": "In December 2011, FINN Partners was born. I served 11 years as the co-CEO of a historic agency that carried my father\u2019s name \u2013 and mine. Yet after 30-plus years of working at that firm, I realized I wanted to build something different \u2013 something bold, meaningful, and amazing for clients, our colleagues, and the communities in which we operate. \u201cAmazing\u201d was, and is, for me an important word. I imagined we could be \u201camazing\u201d every day. I aimed to create a place where talented people could gather \u2013 virtually or in person \u2013 and do big things for clients, and make a difference in the communities important to us.",
