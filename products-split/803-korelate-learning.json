  "description": "At Korelate Learning, we challenge the notion that team-building activities are only about creating a light and fun experience for the team. Of course, fun is important, all learning, especially behaviorbased change, takes place best in a non-threatening, playful manner. But the design of these activities is important, to create a strong foundation for your team to grow their relationships on. They must speak about the core of the issue that you want to address in your team and have impactful learning outcomes that teammates find invaluable as they apply them to life.",
