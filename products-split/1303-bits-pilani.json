  "description": "The Birla Institute of Technology & Science (BITS), Pilani is a prestigious Indian university for higher education in science, technology and humanities. BITS Pilani has consistently ranked amongst the top universities in India. The acceptance rate of BITS Pilani is 1.47% making it the most selective university in India.\n\nThe primary motive of BITS is to \"train young men and women able and eager to create and put into action such ideas, methods, techniques and information\"\u200b. The Institute is a dream come true of its founder late Mr G.D.Birla - an eminent industrialist, a participant in Indian freedom struggle and a close associate of the Father of Indian Nation late Mr. Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (Mahatma Gandhi). What started in early 1900s as a small school, blossomed into a set of colleges for higher education, ranging from the Humanities to Engineering until 1964 when all these colleges amalgamated to culminate into a unique Indian University of International standing. This university was christened as the Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani, known to many as BITS, Pilani.\n",
