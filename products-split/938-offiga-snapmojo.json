  "description": "We are Offiga - pioneers of employee engagement and gift rewards programs for the world\u2019s leading organizations. We started out in 2019 with our retail brand SnapMojo to personalize the way gifting works. We grew rapidly with over 600% revenue growth since our first year and over 30,000+ happy customers. In 2021, we realized that the enterprise gift rewards landscape was broken. Thus, we built Offiga to support enterprise teams that believe deep human connection can create game-changing business results. Fast forward to today and we are one of the fastest growing companies in this space with a client list that includes the likes of Bain & Co., Philips, Gartner, EXL, S&P Global and many more! Our journey has just begun and we are excited for you to be a part of it!",
