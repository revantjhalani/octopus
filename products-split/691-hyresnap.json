Archit Bindal had already conducted more than 500 interviews in 4 years and he had seen first hand all the pain points in the interviewing process. Rajesh is a leadership coach and the biggest pain point of a company was growth. Hiring C-level candidates the company could not think of A-Level growth. Also fixing their wrong hiring was a challenge.",
