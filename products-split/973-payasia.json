  "description": "In mid-2005, the founders of PayAsia observed the aggressive expansion of Payroll Outsourcing. The emergence of Multi-National Companies into the Asia Pacific region had created a \u2018new demand\u2019. There were many local payroll companies, but they were unable to deliver cost effective and high-quality results because of the complex management structure, extensive overheads and Tier-1 software solutions. This is why PayAsia was formed to service the gap in the APAC market, which initially focused on supporting Small and Medium sized enterprises. Today, PayAsia is a leading provider of BPO payroll, payments and HR Solutions across the APAC, Middle East & Africa Regions and has grown to 14 international offices, paying client employees in 80+ countries.",
