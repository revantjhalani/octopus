  "description": "Our story began in an Estonian garage in 2010. Pipedrive\u2019s co-founders were salespeople who needed more from a CRM tool than the software on the market could offer. So, they built an easy-to-use, visual sales platform to help users streamline their processes and get more done. Since then, we\u2019ve grown into a global unicorn. Our team of 850+ people across eight countries works tirelessly toward one goal: empowering small businesses everywhere to succeed. Backed by global investment firm Vista Equity Partners and with the support of our thriving community, we continuously strive to push the boundaries of what an easy-to-use and effective sales CRM can do to help small businesses win more deals.",
