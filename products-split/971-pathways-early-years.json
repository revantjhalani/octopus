  "description": "Implementing the ideas laid out by national and international experts, Pathways World School, Gurgaon was the first school to be launched under the Pathways umbrella in the year 2003. The curriculum includes the Primary Years, Middle Years and Diploma Programme of the International Baccalaureate Organisation of Geneva. Pathways Aravali was the first IB Continuum School in North India and the first residential school in the region to follow the IB curriculum. The school applies the Multiple Intelligences approach, developed by Dr. Howard Gardner from Harvard University. The campus is situated in 34 acres of land on an elevated, wooded site along the majestic foothills of the Aravali Hills. This not only ensures a tranquil environment away from the rush and din of city life, but also offers a magnificent scenic panorama across the hills. Despite its unique location, the school is only 35 kilometers from the Delhi International Airport and falls within the NCR.",
