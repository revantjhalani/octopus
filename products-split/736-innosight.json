  "description": "Disruptive change is accelerating, and companies today face more ambiguity than ever before. But with ambiguity comes opportunity. Business leaders equipped to act in the face of uncertainty can build paths to growth that have not yet been imagined. Traditional approaches to strategy and growth are insufficient to meet the challenge. Most strategy consulting firms analyze the past to predict the future. They are facing the wrong way. Innosight looks at the world differently. We\u2019re in the future business. As the leading expert on disruptive innovation and strategic transformation, we bring a unique set of lenses to growth strategy. We help business leaders develop deep insights into the needs of tomorrow\u2019s customers, align around a shared vision of the future, and then create the organizational momentum to get there. Our approach to innovation consulting is collaborative, and our clients tell us we change the way they think about and see the world, enabling them to do things they could never do before. We build capability, not dependence.",
