  "description": "Our founders, Annil and Tim both UK based from London (England) have been a solid team for over three decades before this project came alive. Their realisation that there was no collaboration software, let alone a high tech one, that could help them work together from different geographies made them conceptualise Wurkr. When separated by distances, Annil and Tim experienced the impact of disconnected and isolated teams on business goals, employee health, creativity and productivity. And thus, they set on a mission to optimise the morale and productivity of distributed workforces. And that\u2019s what we are all about!",
