Digital transformation is no longer the biggest deal. A business can stay ahead only it is able to create influence among customers. This influence results from many things: responding appropriately to an increasingly complex system of consumers, changing expectations, and technology; investing in deeply understanding these consumers; and using these insights to create environments in which customers thrive. Human Factors International (HFI) helps you create such long-lasting relationships with your consumers across all touchpoints and leverage the influence that results from engaging digital experiences.",
